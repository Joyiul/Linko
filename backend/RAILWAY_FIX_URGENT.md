# 🚨 Railway Deployment Fix - Service Unavailable Error

## ❌ **Current Issue**: 
Your backend service is failing health checks because of:
1. Missing dependencies in `requirements.txt`
2. Hardcoded file paths in processing modules
3. Complex imports that fail in Railway environment

## ✅ **Immediate Fix**: Deploy Minimal Version First

### **Step 1: Use Minimal Backend**
1. In Railway backend service → Settings → Variables
2. Add environment variable:
   ```
   PYTHONPATH=/app
   START_COMMAND=python app_minimal.py
   ```

3. Update your Railway service settings:
   - **Root Directory**: `/backend` 
   - **Start Command**: `python app_minimal.py`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt`

### **Step 2: Test Health Check**
Once deployed, test: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`

You should see:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "service": "ImmigrantSlangster API"}
```

### **Step 3: Update Frontend Connection**
1. In Railway frontend service → Variables
2. Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` with your working backend URL
3. Redeploy frontend

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

Your original `app.py` imports these modules that are failing:
```python
from processing.audio_analysis import analyze_audio  # ❌ Has hardcoded paths
from processing.slang_detect import detect_slang     # ❌ Missing dependencies
from processing.robust_emotion_analysis import ...   # ❌ Complex ML dependencies
```

**The problem**: 
- `audio_analysis.py` has hardcoded path: `/Users/keiralie/Documents/...`
- Missing ML dependencies: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`
- File system access issues in Railway sandbox

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Basic Deployment Works**

1. **Fix File Paths**: Replace all hardcoded paths with relative paths
2. **Add Dependencies**: Update `requirements.txt` with all ML libraries
3. **Test Imports**: Ensure all processing modules work in Railway environment
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Add one feature at a time

## 🌐 **Expected Working URLs**:
- **Health Check**: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health`
- **Test Endpoint**: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/test`
- **Speech API**: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/upload-and-analyze`
- **Video API**: `https://your-backend-url.railway.app/upload-and-analyze-video`

The minimal version will deploy successfully and give you working URLs. Then we can add back the AI features gradually! 🚀
